# Midterm Part 2, Frontend  Code

We've already setup the infastructure for you. You just need to implement a couple of methods that will be used to 1) log events that we will generate by interacting with the truffle console, and 2) send ether to our multi-sig wallet contract using our local web3. 

**Before doing anything type 'npm install'** from the command line. This will grab all the dependencies we need to run our react app. It might take a minute or so to run. 

Now run 'npm run start' to boot up the app. You can now navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser and you should see the app's main page. We'll implement the method necesssary to make the "Send Ether" button functional and also the code that logs events in the browser window. All the details are in the skeleton code of /src/App.js. **YOU SHOULD ONLY MAKE CHANGES TO /src/App.js**
